#  TODO
# question: who owns the validation logic around game events?

## Next


## Later
* shuffle the deck
* does Position need more input validation?
* print unflipped card scores (debug mode?)
* 
* handle invalid input. player cannot flip card that is already flipped




## Done
* three-in-a-row logic
* two methods for flipping card: one advances player/one does not
