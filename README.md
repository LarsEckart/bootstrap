#  TODO
# question: who owns the validation logic around game events?

## Next

* win condition, determine that all players have played last turn, even when not all cards flipped


## Later
* NoCard to throw exceptions?
* handle invalid input. player cannot flip card that is already flipped
* shuffle the deck
* does Position need more input validation?
* print unflipped card scores (debug mode?)




## Done
* three-in-a-row logic
* two methods for flipping card: one advances player/one does not
