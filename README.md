#  TODO

## Deck

* shuffle the deck
* print unflipped card scores (debug mode?)
* two methods for flipping card: one advances player/one does not
* does Position need more input validation?
* handle invalid input. player cannot flip card that is already flipped
* three-in-a-row logic
* win condition
next time lars does more typing and James talks and thinks


# question: who owns the validation logic around game events?
