#  TODO

## Deck

* shuffle the deck
* print unflipped card scores (debug mode?)
* two methods for flipping card: one advances player/one does not
* ~~time for a position class?~~
* does Position need more input validation?
* handle invalid input. player cannot flip card that is already flipped
* PlayerFlipsCard needs to use Position class


# question: who owns the validation logic around game events?
